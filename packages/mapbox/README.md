# Sensor Dashboard: `mapbox`

## Purpose

This package contains our own abstractions over the [Mapbox GL JS library](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/), specifically for geocoding a location based on a set of coordinates.

## Consuming the package

For more information on how the web application ([`apps/web`](/apps/web/)) consumes the `mapbox` package, please inspect the [`web` documentation](/apps/web/).
